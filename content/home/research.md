Language processing means how a brain or a computer transforms sounds or text into meaning, or how meaning is transformed into sounds or text. Our research focuses on three main topics.

* **What is natural language?** Natural language solves the problem of allowing humans to communicate, given the costs and difficulties involved in speaking and understanding. We hypothesize that the structure of natural language is determined by maximizing information transfer while minimizing the complexity of communication, and that the many diverse languages of the world are all different solutions to this common problem. We formalize and test this hypothesis using information theory, cognitive modeling, behavioral experiments, and crosslinguistic corpus studies studying the universal properties of languages at multiple levels.

* **Language processing in humans.** What goes on in the human mind when we produce and comprehend language? How do we process information while listening or reading, and how do we plan and articulate complex utterances expressing our meanings? These are the questions studied in language processing. We use models from information theory, machine learning, and robotics to study language comprehension and production, and test our theories using experimental data such as reading times.

* **Language processing in machines.** How can we build machines to produce and understand human language? We study how modern machine learning paradigms such as neural networks and deep learning can be used to learn the structure of human language, and how methods from linguistics and psycholinguistics can be used to understand the behavior of complex machine learning systems.
