The **Language Processing Group** is a research group in the [Department of Language Science](https://langsci.uci.edu/) at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/).

We study language processing in humans and machines.
Our goal is to understand how human language works using computational modeling, machine learning, large datasets, behavioral experiments, and information theory.
